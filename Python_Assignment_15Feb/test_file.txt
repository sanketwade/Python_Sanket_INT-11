The Ramayana is an ancient Indian epic about Prince Rama,
his wife Sita, and his loyal brother Lakshmana. 
When Sita is abducted by the demon king Ravana, 
Rama, with the help of Hanuman and an army of monkeys,
wages war to rescue her. After a fierce battle,
Rama defeats Ravana and brings Sita back to Ayodhya. 
However, doubts about her purity lead Sita to undergo a trial by fire, proving her chastity.
Ultimately, Rama fulfills his destiny as a just ruler,
symbolizing dharma (righteousness) and devotion.
